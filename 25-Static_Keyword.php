 Problem 25: Use the static keyword to implement static properties and methods in a class,
  like allowing users to call a static method like User::getById($id) to get a user by ID.

 - The static keyword can be used to define properties and methods that belong to the class
 rather than instances of the class.
 
 - This can be useful for methods that need to be called without creating an instance of the class.
