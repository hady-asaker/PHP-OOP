 Problem 19: Create an abstract class called Food that has properties like name,
  calories, and ingredients.
  Implement a getTaste() method that will be overridden by child classes.
  Create several child classes that inherit from the Food class, such as Pizza, Burger,
  and Salad. Use the concept of inheritance to share common properties and methods
  between the child classes.
